Not finished

Still need to calculate protection and delivery for bedding

payment total calculates perfectly for 6 month term. But is barely off for 24 and 60. There is an APR of 2% (I think) applied for these two longer terms. The trouble is definitely with APR. right now selecting APR doesn't change 6 month term at all. Possibly because PMT calc in excel is 12 months? Idk check and recheck.
